The prompt for this first blog asked me to talk about why I chose to learn computer programming; it's as good of a place to start as any.

I've always been good with technology. When I was in kindergarten, I remember helping teachers with their printers, or setting up programs on the old Apple computers we had in the classroom. It was the kind of thing that came to me easily, and I earned a reputation as the "tech" person in my family and friend group.

I played around on family computers for years, and received my own (a Packard Bell, with a 14.4 modem!) in 1994, when I was ten. Over the years, I'd learn how to take it apart, upgrade components, and screw around with settings to get around AOL's child restrictions. I remember .dll hell almost fondly. I graduated to Macs when Apple made the switch to Intel in the mid 00s, which has lead me to a job as a Technical Expert at an Apple retail store, which mostly revolves around helping people reset their passwords.

Through the years, I never really got into programming. When everyone else was learning HTML to make fancy Myspace pages, I was writing in a LiveJournal and writing music. Not until after getting an iPod touch the first winter they were availble did I consider that maybe it would be cool to not only help other people use their devices, but to also write the programs that could make those devices easier to understand.

Still, it would be years before I actually sat down and looked at it. Due to a family member stealing my identity, I didn't finish college, and ended up spending ten years recovering from the financial fallout. I was depressed, stuck in a dead end job that I hated, and couldn't imagine going back to school.

Two years ago, I was lucky enough to pick up jobs with Apple and with The University of Michigan. I spent most of the time since then working 70 hours a week, paying off my debt, and doing research on what my next move should be. I'd used someone's code to put together a Twitter bot, had to fiddle with some preferences files to set up a Minecraft server, and hacked together a formula in Numbers to make my budgeting life eaiser. All these tiny steps, combined with making several friends in Ann Arbor's developing tech scene, caused me to take a serious look at learning to code.

The thing that appeals to me most, I think, is the logical structure of working in code. Organizing commands just right, to make a program do what you want, and then sharing that with people is appealing to me. The thing I've enjoyed most in my decade of working in retail is helping make other people's lives easier, and my hope is that I can contribute to software that does the same.

I have never struggled to learn anything in my life, and have never developed study skills, so I'm worried that this could be more of a challenge than I'm ready for. My initial plan was to attened an on-site immersive camp, but I couldn't get the money together to do so. Because of this, I'll have to balance working 54 hours a week with trying to work on coding 20+ hours a week without losing my sanity or my relationship.

I hope I am up to the challenge.
