I work two jobs, for between 50 and 60 hours a week. Up until just before I started this class, I had been working 70 hours a week for two years. In that time, I was able to pay off a lot of old debts, start to build my credit, and take steps that allowed me to afford this class. It was exhausting, but necessary.

Now, I'm trying to add an additional 20+ hours of studying on top of that, while still maintaining a healthy relationship and getting enough sleep. It's crazy what a poor balance with all this can do to you; when I dropped to 54 hours a week, I felt lazy, because I was getting more than four or five hours of sleep a night. I actually have an entire day off every now and then, and it makes me antsy if I don't get up and GO on those days.

In the last month, I have struggled to keep up the level of work that I think is necessary for me to be successful. I took a few days off when my girlfriend's grandmother died. I work for Apple, and it's iPhone launch season, which always means extra hours there. Even just taking a half hour to eat dinner, or, god forbid, and hour to cook and eat dinner feels like I'm pushing back finishing the program.

My initial plan was to do an on-site immersive program, because I wanted to avoid issues like this, but my budget didn't allow it. So now, I try to integrate studying into the other important parts of my life. I'm lucky to have an understanding partner, and that my schedule with both jobs is generally pretty set.

I went to Orlando to celebrate the birthday of my best friend last weekend, and came back with a cold. I feel like garbage, just want to sleep, and would love to take another night off.

But here I go, back to the grind.
